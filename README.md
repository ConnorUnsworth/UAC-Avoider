# ${UAC Avoider}

	Allows any file to be run as admin (if you have permissions) without prompting UAC.

## How it works

	Takes in a file, generates an unique identifier and configures a scheduled task to be run as 'highest priviliges'
	Shortcut runs the task, which avoids the UAC prompt

## Installation
	Just run the code in PowerShell, ISE or run the .exe


## Usage

	Run
	Select a file
	Select a save location
	Go!
